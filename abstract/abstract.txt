Abstract:

We are going to explore a subset of the data using a relational event model. A relational event sequence is an order- or time-stamped series of observations indicating when an actor carried out a specific action, or interacted with another actor. The occurrence of events is modelled using standard survival analysis techniques but where the past relational history is considered when defining the probability of an specific event happening in the future.
