Abstract:

In 2019 various Latin-American countries faced protests and strikes showing dissatisfaction with corruption, low education investments, and economic inequality. At the end of November 2019 Colombia, faced a very intense week of protests where many types of events occurred: large scale manifestations, cacerolazos (demonstrations where saucepans are banged as a sign of protest), confrontations with anti-riot police, and a spread of fake news around violence and threads in Bogota and Cali. Some of these events originated in social media, but almost all of them were saw a reflection there.  To understand these events and relevant agents (politicians, media, journalists, artists, etc.), we pulled data from Twitterâ€™s API using the rtweet R package and extracted around one million tweets ranging between the 20th to the 24th of November 2019 associated with the protest (via relevant keywords and hahstags). In this talk we will present an analysis of this data focusing on the following aspects. First, we are going to do a text analysis and topic development during the strike. To complement this research, we are going to analyse topical timelines with reports from the media, aiming see if specific narratives around the facts were consolidated differently within different spheres. Second, we will do a network analysis of most relevant agents in the network using retweets and engagement subnetworks. We use statistics to look at social network behaviour to create unbiased, standardised results that systematically disentangle patterns not necessarily visible through a single-user twitter interface, or with traditional statistical methods.
